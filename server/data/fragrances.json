        "description": "Sauvage is an act of creation inspired by wide-open spaces. An ozone blue sky that dominates a white-hot rocky landscape. The strong gust of citrus in Sauvage Eau de Toilette is powerfully anchored by the ambery nobleness of ambroxan, resinous elemi and woods. Instantly recognizable, it has become a genuine signature scent, unique* in its confident virility. Like a deep breath of fresh air, Sauvage Eau de Toilette is a bold composition for a man who is authentic and true.",

Sauvage Eau de Parfum is thus the olfactory interpretation of a moment tinted with a thick blue that unleashes the wildest instincts. In the hour when the wolves come out and the sky is set ablaze, a new magic unfolds.Sauvage Eau de Parfum teams the freshness of a juicy, spicy Calabrian bergamot note with the sensuality of a mysterious and enveloping Papua New Guinean vanilla extract accord to unfurl a powerful and noble trail.",
